Dowaload darknetRISCVV repository. 

Note: It is necessary to first build NNPACKRISCV and create the static library
cd darknetRISCVV
Step 1: Please enable the macro by uncommenting
#define NNPACK 1
from include/darknet.h

Step 2: Use Makefile_NNPACK from makefiles folder to compile the software with winograd implementation support. 
Step 3: Change the compiler Path and Library linking path (NNPACKRISCV/lib.a) in the Makefile if necessary. 
Step 4: Please use the "make" command to compile the software. 
Step 5: This will craete the static binary file.  


Execution: 
This executable has been tested with GEM5 and SPIKE. 
With SPIKE: The generated file has been tested with vector lengths from 512-bit to 4096-bit. 
With Gem5: The generated binary file has been testes with 512-bit to 16384-bit. 



Current Limitations: In winograd implementations, the utilization of full vector length for tuple mutiplication is limiting upto 4096-bit only due to block size set as 32.
